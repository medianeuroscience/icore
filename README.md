# iCoRe - The GDELT interface for Communication Research

This project introduces the interface for Communication Research (iCoRe) to access, explore, and analyze the Global Database of Events, Language and Tone (GDELT; Leetaru &amp; Schrodt, 2013). GDELT provides a vast, open source, and constantly updated repository of online news and event metadata collected from tens of thousands of news outlets around the world. Despite GDELTâ€™s promise for advancing communication science, its massive scale and complex data structures have hindered efforts of communication scholars aiming to access and analyze GDELT. We thus developed iCoRe, an easy-to-use web interface that (a) provides fast access to the data available in GDELT (b) shapes and processes GDELT for theory-driven applications within communication research and (c) enables replicability through transparent query and analysis protocols.
