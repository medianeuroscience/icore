# iCoRe - The GDELT interface for Communication Research

This project introduces the interface for Communication Research (iCoRe) to access, explore, and analyze the Global Database of Events, Language and Tone (GDELT; Leetaru &amp; Schrodt, 2013). GDELT provides a vast, open source, and constantly updated repository of online news and event metadata collected from tens of thousands of news outlets around the world. Despite GDELTâ€™s promise for advancing communication science, its massive scale and complex data structures have hindered efforts of communication scholars aiming to access and analyze GDELT. We thus developed iCoRe, an easy-to-use web interface that (a) provides fast access to the data available in GDELT (b) shapes and processes GDELT for theory-driven applications within communication research and (c) enables replicability through transparent query and analysis protocols.

All of the code, data, and analyses of this project can be viewed and executed interactively through binder.
Please allow binder up to 60 seconds for the environment to load and install necessary dependencies.
